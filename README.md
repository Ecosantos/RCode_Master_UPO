RCode - Master - UPO

R Code for my Master course at UPO: "Ecological methods in R". This is a very short course where I outline several different methods for data analysis in ecology.
I focus specifically on multivariate analysis, spatial patterns, phylogenetic comparative methods, and network analysis.
